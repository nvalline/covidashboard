### Roadmap

Future improvements for the application:

- Add notifications to events, either push or email, that will execute after two weeks; this will alert users that they can likely delete the event if they feel there are no symptoms in that time period
- Create an interatctive trend chart that allows users to select different datapoints to chart; some examples, from the API call, include:
  - Total positive/negative tests
  - Total currently hospitalized
  - Total currently in ICU
  - Total deaths
- Expand application to other disease/virus/illnesses
  - Example: Utilize event tracking as a teacher, for tracking when a child comes to school with flu-like symptoms
